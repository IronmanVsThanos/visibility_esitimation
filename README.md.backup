# Fog-Vision: Accurate Image-based Visibility Estimation

## Introduction
Fog-Vision is a novel end-to-end framework for image-based visibility estimation, featuring a dual-branch architecture with Automatic Seed Region Segmentation (ASRS) and Fog Feature Guided Attention (FFGA) modules. This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "Fog-Vision: Accurate Image-based Visibility Estimation with Dual-branch Neural Networks".

## Key Features
- VED-8k Dataset: A large-scale dataset with 8,000+ annotated visibility images
- Dual-branch Architecture:
  - Primary Branch: Automatic Seed Region Segmentation (ASRS)
  - Secondary Branch: Flexible backbone support (CNNs, Transformers)
- Fog Feature Guided Attention (FFGA) module
- State-of-the-art Performance:
  - Accuracy: 97.7%
  - Precision: 97.2%
  - Recall: 95.2%
